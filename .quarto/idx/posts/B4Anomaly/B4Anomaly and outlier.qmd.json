Some popular methods include:\n\nInterquartile Range (IQR) Method: This method identifies outliers as data points that fall outside a certain range, typically 1.5 times the IQR below the first quartile or above the third quartile.\n\nBoxplot Method: Boxplots visually represent the distribution of data and highlight outliers as points outside the whiskers.\n\nZ-score Method: This method measures the number of standard deviations a data point lies from the mean.
